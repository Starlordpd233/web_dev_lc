Plans for web features:
1. course selection planner:
– currently students have to go through the pdf and find the courses, put it down somewhere on a piece of paper or something, and then
count the number of courses/etc.
– our goal is to make an interface where they can easily and conveniently choose the courses that they want, put it down, and then verify
if they are good for the graduation requirements or maximum courses allowed, number of credts offered, etc. 

2. study resources hub: 
– holds various resources for various classes, especially math and sciences
