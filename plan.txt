Plans for web features:
1. course selection planner:
– currently students have to go through the pdf and find the courses, put it down somewhere on a piece of paper or something, and then
count the number of courses/etc.
– our goal is to make an interface where they can easily and conveniently choose the courses that they want, put it down, and then verify
if they are good for the graduation requirements or maximum courses allowed, number of credts offered, etc. 
– for prerequisite mentioned in the course description, we can add the feature that, based on the user's input about the courses that've already taken
so far, that automatically tells me whether they're missing a prerequisite, when they select this course. Add this feature later once core features are
done. 




Next steps for database:
1. add the grade
2. add the department for all courses; put courses under them in json tree
– English, Languages, Mathematics, Science, HPR, Social Science, Computer Science, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Study Abroad
3. use title for prerequisite
4. identify any corrupted names from the responses by AI


sample field in json tree:

{
    "title": "course title",
    "description": "description."
    "department": "department"
    "gesc": false,
    "ppr": false,
    "duration": "full-year" or "term" or "two terms" "half course"
    "required": true,
    "grades": [
        9
    ],
    "prerequisite": null // or ["A2A", true/false]
} 


2. study resources hub: 
– holds various resources for various classes, especially math and sciences 
– For certain classes that we have enough information, we can ask teachers for course syllabus
