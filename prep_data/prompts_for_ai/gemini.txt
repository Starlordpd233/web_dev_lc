Carefully analyze the attached photos/screenshots, take as long as you need. they are screenshots from a PDF document 
containing the information on course offerings and their descriptions. 
I need to transform this PDF into accurate conversion into markdown file that I will later use, which is a better format for data collection 
from this document than PDF. What's very annoying about this PDF is that it's not written and organized in a typical PDF. 


As you can see in the PDF, it is composed of rectangular sections or blocks of courses; each little section is its own course, 
with the course title as the first line (may contain the phrase "GESC" or "PPR" or not), 
and the second line is a subheader that indicates: to which class year it is offered (ex. sophomore), 
if it's a term course/half course (if not mentioned that means year course as default), and which term it is offered (if not mentioned, 
that means it's offered year-round). And then lastly is the course description, with prerequisites at the end of it if mentioned. 


For the header that contains the course title, adopt this format for consistency:
start the line with "###", capitalize all letters; append "(GESC)" and/or "(PPR)" in parenthesis if specified.


For the subheader, adopt this format of syntax for consistency: start the line with "####" and wrap the subheader with "_" at the start and end.
Sample format is this: 
"#### _[course duration (term, half, or year)]; [which term (fall, winter, spring, or combination of terms)]; [to which class it is offered (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, or any combination of them)]; [whether offered in 2025-26 or not]_"
Seperate fields with semicolons. For fields in the above example format that are not mentioned in the original PDF, leave it blank. 
Keep the exact information as written on the PDF. 
The above example format is a comprehenisve one that covers all possible fields; any subheader could have any combination of the different fields, so
that's why for simplicity and best practice you should record exactly what's written on the PDF. 



Sometimes there are courses that are listed under a red text, saying "Elective Term Course" or something to that effect. For the courses that appear
under this header, adopt this example format:

**Below are Elective Term Courses**
<!-- electives:start -->

### ASTRONOMY I: INTRODUCTION TO ASTRONOMY AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM
#### _fall term · juniors and seniors_
…description…
**Prerequisite:** Chemistry or Physics

### ASTRONOMY II: OBSERVING THE UNIVERSE
#### _two-term · winter and spring · juniors and seniors_
…description…
**Prerequisite:** Chemistry or Physics

...
<!-- electives:end -->



The page, as you can see, has 3 vertical columns, and so the courses are within each of the column. Also, sometimes, there will be a bigger header
that specifies the start of a new category of courses, 
under which there's a paragraph of text description of the category itself which are NOT the actual information that I will need. From now on for other 
documents that I will attach later, what you need to do is to keep the big headers and delete this paragraph of bolded (bigger) texts that are clearly not information 
about the courses themselves, which are explanations of what these electives/categories are, that are not needed for my markdown file. 
Be sure to clearly identify the exact texts before deleting to confirm the precision of your deletion. 

The document (images) might also sometimes contain other "non-course" blocks that have the same format with the real courses. One exampel is
the study (school year) abroad programs. I don't need these programs (study abroad programs might be the only one in this category; correct me if I'm wrong).
However, for all 'Indepedent Studies" or something of that sort where it is
still mentioned as a 'course' that student can take (most often as term courses), still keep those.


Here is what I need you to help me for: you have to have a solid understanding of the format of the organization of the PDF from the attached 
images and then help me 
check the content of my markdown file so that it accurately ONLY contains information about the courses only. Follow the format as instructed above.


I have attached the images and the markdown file. Check and then rewrite.
While you do the conversion, make sure you pay attention to any typos or any other error 
sections/sentences that clearly has a misinformation during previous conversion. Your ultimate goal is to make sure that this markdown
file is exactly the same as what's written on the PDF (or in the screenshots).



Provide me with the complete, consolidated raw code in markdown syntax.
