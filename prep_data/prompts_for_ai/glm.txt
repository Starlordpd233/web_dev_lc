The attached PDF is a document containing the information on course offerings and their descriptions. 
I need to transform this PDF into accurate conversion into markdown file that I will later use, which is a better format for data collection 
of this document than PDF. What's very annoying about this PDF is that it's not written and organized in a typical PDF. As you can see in the PDF, 
it is composed of little rectangular sections of courses; each little section is an own course, with the course title as the first line 
(may contain the phrase "GESC" or not; wrap it in a patenthesis in the markdown file if it appears after the title of the course), 
and the second line is a subheader that indicated to which class year it is offered (ex. sophomore), 
if it's a term course (for those not marked with 'term course' means it's year round'), and which term it is offered (if which term is not mentioned, 
that means it's offered year-round and we don't have to mark this in the markdown file; only mark for those ocurses that are explicitly labelled
as offered in which term). So the sub-header under the title of the course will contain a different combination of the following categories: 
term course, to which class year the course is offered, which term it is offered (this last category only appears in the 'writing workshop' I believe).


The page, as you can see, has 3 vertical columns, and so the courses are within each of the column. Also, sometimes, there will be a bigger header, 
such as "CL Senior Writing Seminars", under which there's a paragraph of text description of what they are, which are NOT the actual information 
that I will need. For other headers that appears not within the courses' descriptions but somewhere in the middle, 
that are clearly indicating the start of a new cateogry or section of courses, be sure to clearly mark that in the markdown file in an obvious syntax.



This is what I need you to help me for: you have to have a solid understanding of the format of the organization of the PDF is and then help me 
revise the content of my markdown file so that it ONLY contains information about the courses only â€“ the title of the courses, which category 
the courses belong, and the other sections of information that need to be retained and converted accurately. Things like the text line at the 
upper right corner of the first page 'Term Courses for Seniors' should also be retained, and should be placed, for this instance, after the previous 
coure "CL English III Seminar" and before "English IV: banned books", clearly labelled to indicate that the courses that come after this line are 
term courses for seniors. Be mindful of things like this as we go on, even though in this PDF attached this might be the only instance like this. 
Help me revise the content of the markdown file.


Below is the content of the markdown file. While you do the ocnversion, make sure you pay attention to any typos or any other error 
sections/sentences that clearly has a misinformation during previous conversion:
