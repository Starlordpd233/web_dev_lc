Carefully analyze the attached PDF, take as long as you need. It is a document containing the information on course offerings and their descriptions. 
I need to transform this PDF into accurate conversion into markdown file that I will later use, which is a better format for data collection 
from this document than PDF. What's very annoying about this PDF is that it's not written and organized in a typical PDF. As you can see in the PDF, 
it is composed of little rectangular sections of courses; each little section is its own course, with the course title as the first line 
(may contain the phrase "GESC" or not; wrap it in a parenthesis in the markdown file if it appears after the title of the course), 
and the second line is a subheader that indicates: to which class year it is offered (ex. sophomore), 
if it's a term course/half course (for those not marked with 'term course' or mentioned with at which term – fall, winter, or spring –
means it's year round course'), and which term it is offered. if which term is not mentioned, 
that means it's offered year-round and we don't have to mark this in the markdown file; only mark for those courses that are explicitly labelled
as offered in which term. So the sub-header under the title of the course will contain a different combination of the following categories: 
term course (whether specified with fall, winter, or spring), and to which class year the course is offered. 
Be sure to clearly indicate this subheader in some obvious syntax
in the markdown file for better readability: wrap the line around with "*"; for example, "term course - spring term/junior". Be sure to copy the
exact information as written on the PDF.


The page, as you can see, has 3 vertical columns, and so the courses are within each of the column. Also, sometimes, there will be a bigger header, 
under which there's a paragraph of text description of what they are, which are NOT the actual information that I will need. From now on for other 
doucments that I will attach later, what you need to do is to delete the paragraph of bolded (bigger) texts that are clearly not information 
about the courses, which are explanations of what these electives/categories are, that are not needed for my markdown file. 
Be sure to clearly identify the exact texts before deleting to confirm the precision of your deletion. For other headers that appears 
not within the courses' descriptions but somewhere in the middle, 
that are clearly indicating the start of a new cateogry or section of courses, be sure to clearly mark that in the markdown file in an obvious syntax.



This is what I need you to help me for: you have to have a solid understanding of the format of the organization of the PDF is and then help me 
check the content of my markdown file so that it accurately ONLY contains information about the courses only – the title of the courses, 
which category the courses belong, and the other sections of information that need to be retained and converted accurately. 
Headers that indicate the start of a new category or section of courses should be
clearly labelled to indicate that the courses that come after this line are term courses for seniors. Be mindful of things like this as we go on, 
even though in this PDF attached this might be the only instance like this. Help me revise the content of the markdown file.


I have attached two versions of the markdown file. You should cross analyze and compare between these two versions, 
and the use your analysis tool of the PDF to check again the accuracy. While you do the conversion, 
make sure you pay attention to any typos or any other error sections/sentences that clearly has a misinformation during previous conversion. 
Identify and the list out, if there is any, of places that are incorrect first. Then, provide me with the consolidated, 
updated, complete markdown file, in raw code.
