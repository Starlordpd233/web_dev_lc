# GEOMETRY-ALGEBRAI

GEOMETRY - ALGEBRA IThis course is for those students who either have not had a full year of Algebra I or need to strengthen their algebra skills before heading into Algebra II and subsequent curriculum. It covers properties of the real number system, linear and quadratic equations, and properties of exponents and radicals while also introducing students to Euclidean geometry of two and three dimensions. Students develop competence with the graphs of linear, quadratic, and exponential equations, and master multiple techniques for solving equations and simplifying algebraic expressions. This course emphasizes the development of algebraic and geometric skills and utilizes Desmos, Delta Math, Problem Attic, and Geogebra. Students who successfully complete this course will have met the diploma requirement for Geometry and be prepared for Algebra II.

# GEOMETRY

GEOMETRYThis course in Euclidean geometry investigates the definitions, postulates, and theorems of two- and three- dimensional figures and develops students' proficiency in analyzing and communicating mathematically ideas effectively. An emphasis is placed on deductive reasoning, proofs, and geometric problem- solving. When appropriate, students utilize technology to enhance the learning process. Algebraic skills are solidified through the application of geometrical properties with numerical solutions. Prerequisite: Algebra I

ADVANCED GEOMETRYThis course covers the same materials as Geometry but at a faster pace, in greater depth, and with greater rigor. In addition, students will complete a more thorough study of trigonometry and coordinate geometry. This course is designed for qualified students who have had two full years of algebra and a demonstrated motivation for the study of mathematics. Prerequisite: Algebra II and permission of the department

# ALGEBRA II

ALGEBRA IIThis course reinforces and further develops the concepts presented in Algebra I and Geometry - Algebra I, including linear and quadratic equations and inequalities. It then goes on to explore functions involving radical expressions and rational polynomials and finally considers logarithmic and exponential functions and their applications. Beyond traditional algebraic techniques, students learn numerical and graphical solution techniques with the guided use of technology.Additional topics such as trigonometry, complex numbers, and sequences and series may be introduced along the way. Prerequisite:Algebra I or Geometry- Algebra I

# ADVANCED ALGEBRA II

ADVANCED ALGEBRA IIThis course is designated for students who have excelled in comprehensive first- year algebra course and have demonstrated motivation for the study of mathematics. It covers the same material as Algebra II at a faster pace, in more detail, and with greater emphasis on problem- solving and logical reasoning. In addition, students begin their study of precalculus exploring sequences and series, complex numbers and fractals, transformations and combinations of functions, and unit circle trigonometry.

Prerequisite: Algebra I and permission of the department

# PRECALCULUS

PRECALCULUSThe Precalculus course continues the study of functions and relations that was begun in Algebra II. This course is intended for students who have completed both Algebra II and Geometry and who aspire to take calculus or one of the statistics offerings in the following year. Students study the properties, graphs, and applications of a variety of different families of functions including linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. These functions are explored graphically, algebraically, and numerically. The analysis of the functions is aided by the guided use of technology. While students have exposure to all the classic functions of high school math, the course is not intended for those who wish to move into the CL Calculus program. Additionally, the course includes material from discrete math, including sequences, series, combinatorics, and an introduction to probability and statistics.

# ADVANCED PRECALCULUS

ADVANCED PRECALCULUSThis course is for students who have a strong background in algebra and geometry and who plan on taking CL Calculus AB or possibly CL Statistics. Students study the properties, graphs, and applications of a variety of families of functions including linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric. Technology is used as an aid for students to make observations and investigate connections among algebraic, graphical, and numerical representations of functions. In Advanced Precalculus there is less emphasis on the discrete topics of probability and statistics than in the Precalculus course; however, trigonometric functions and their inverses as well as the notion of limits are covered in greater depth and detail since these topics are critical foundations for the CL Calculus program.

During the fall and winter terms, students complete the precalculus curriculum, including a review of exponential and logarithmic functions and a study of trigonometry, probability, and parametric and polar equations. Then, during the spring term, students have a rigorous introduction to differential calculusâ€”a prerequisite for entry into the CL Calculus BC course. This course emphasizes critical thinking, problem solving, and synthesis of the material. Some students may opt to study CL Statistics in addition to, or instead of, CL Calculus after this course.

# TOPICS IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS fall term

TOPICS IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS fall termThis course explores multiple real- life mathematical applications and the theory behind them. Topics include voting/election theory, the mathematics of fair division, and the mathematics of apportionment pertaining to government bodies. As time permits, students will also explore further topics including financial literacy, gerrymandering, electoral college system, graph theory, and the mathematics of scheduling. This course is designed for both those who intend to take statistics in the winter and spring terms and those who have an interest in an elective mathematics course strongly based in theory and real- world applications.
