# BIOLOGYI

# freshmen and sophomores

This introductory course is organized around four biological themes: change over time, communication, transfer of energy and matter, and homeostasis. Through the lens of these themes, students are able to more deeply understand and appreciate all biological systems. Topics studied include evolution, cell and molecular biology, and human anatomy and physiology. The use of hands- on modeling activities enhances student engagement and understanding. In the lab, students learn how to design well- controlled experiments and how to analyze collected data. Through this lab work, students gain hands- on experience with current techniques used in research laboratories.

# ADVANCED BIOLOGYI

This course is an introductory biology class for students who have had a full year of chemistry. It covers the same topics as Biology I but emphasizes the biochemical processes in greater depth and detail. As with Biology I, students learn to think critically about how living organisms evolve and survive and are encouraged to make connections to all biological processes within the natural world. The course makes frequent use of case studies to facilitate application of the course content to complex real- world problems. Students spend ample time in the laboratory practicing many of the techniques used in research laboratories today, collecting and analyzing data, and discussing current research topics. Prerequisites: Chemistry and permission of the department

Inquiry- based laboratory experiments follow the suggestions of the AP curriculum and support the concepts studied in class. Lab work helps students develop proficiency with basic analytical laboratory techniques, and students are frequently asked to design their own protocols to solve problems. This course prepares students for the Advanced Placement examination. Prerequisite: Advanced Chemistry I and/or permission of the department

# CL PHYSICS II

This problem- solving intensive course pushes students to consider more deeply the topics introduced in Advanced Physics I and to investigate challenging questions incorporating calculus techniques. Dynamic classroom discussions, extensive small group investigations, and laboratory work centered on experimental design enable students to develop confidence and a strong conceptual mastery. The first half of the course focuses on mechanics — covering Newton's laws, conservation of energy and momentum, rotational dynamics, simple harmonic motion, and universal gravitation. The second half explores electricity and magnetism — delving deeply into Coulomb's Law, Gauss's Law, Ampere's Law, Faraday's Law, and circuits involving capacitors and inductors. This course fully prepares students for Advanced Placement examinations in both Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism. Prerequisite: Advanced Physics I; Co- requisite: CL Calculus BC or CL Calculus AB with permission of department

# CL ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE GESC

This course provides students with the scientific concepts and methodologies to understand the interrelationships within the natural world. Through on- campus field trips and hands- on activities, students will come to a solid understanding of the core ecological principles. In addition, they will learn to identify and analyze environmental problems within the natural world; relative risks will be evaluated and alternative solutions to problems will be examined. Topics covered include ecological foundations and principles, introduction to plant science, energy, climate change, human population and demographics, toxicology, pollution and pandemics, freshwater resources,

water quality, and global water issues. Students learn to observe environmental systems critically and to develop and conduct well- designed experiments with the goal of making positive changes to the local Loomis Chaffee campus and surrounding ecosystem and in the spirit of environmental stewardship and sustainability. This course covers the majority, but not the entirety, of the AP Environmental Science curriculum; those students interested in sitting for the AP Environmental Science exam in May will need to complete some independent work to prepare for that exam and should consult with the instructor to identify those additional topics.

# CL GUIDED RESEARCH PROJECTS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

halfcourse/seniors

CL GUIDED RESEARCH PROJECTS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGYhalfcourse/seniorsGuided Research Projects are yearlong, half courses in the science department that allow students who have completed the graduation requirements for science, and those with an interest in the biological and biomedical sciences, to engage in sustained, significant, mentored scientific research. In this capstone class, students conduct authentic research in molecular biology, and with guidance, design their own research question using an established model system for that experimental work (one that matches the expertise of a Loomis Chaffee science faculty member). Projects involve sustained skill acquisition and the development of rigorous scientific methodology; they also require the student to master experimental techniques that go beyond the traditional science department curriculum. Students maintain a research quality notebook and document their results in either extended lab report or scientific poster format, and they present their research findings to an audience at the end of the school year. Acceptance into the Guided Research Project is a competitive process and interested students are required to complete a written application. Prerequisites: fulfillment of or co- enrollment in CL Biology electives and permission of the department

# CL GUIDED RESEARCH PROJECTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY GESC halfcourse/seniors

This Guided Research Project is an experiential learning approach to environmental stewardship and sustainability using Loomis Chaffee as a location of study and action. Students learn about all the facets of campus sustainability including waste management, energy conservation, water demands, and agriculture. They then put their learning to work as they design and execute their own sustainability project here on campus. Student projects have included renewable energy generation, food waste reduction, residential weatherproofing, the invention of environmentally friendly cleaning products, environmental justice initiatives, and many others. Prerequisite: Biology, Chemistry; pre/co- requisite CL Environmental Science or Ecology and permission of the department

# CL SENIOR WRITING SEMINAR: COMMUNICATING SCIENCE

term course/seniors

CL SENIOR WRITING SEMINAR: COMMUNICATING SCIENCEterm course/seniorsAt the intersection of observation, experiment, and narrative lies the realm of scientific writing. In this course, students grapple with various forms of scientific communication — from the precise language of technical journals to the relatable prose of popular science. They learn to adapt complex topics for various audiences, craft persuasive arguments rooted in evidence, and communicate clearly through data presentation and visualization. This course is not confined to one scientific discipline but will explore a variety of topics which might include public health, particle physics, astrobiology, or cybernetics. At times, students will choose the scientific topics that most intrigue them for their written pieces. For instance, one student might write an abstract distilling a groundbreaking paper in particle physics, while another pens a persuasive article for the public on the need for increased funding to address mosquito- borne disease. This course not only develops key writing tools for students eyeing a future in scientific research but also opens doors for those writers who wish to bring the magic of science to broader audiences.
