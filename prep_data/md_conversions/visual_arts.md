# DRAWINGI

offered as a term course and halfcourse

DRAWING Ioffered as a term course and halfcourseThis course builds basic drawing skills, which form the foundation for later creative work in drawing as well as in all other media. Class work introduces students to observational drawing and to techniques used to represent the three- dimensional world on a two- dimensional surface. Through the study of still life and other imagery, students work in pencil, charcoal, and pen and ink to learn about line, value, and rudimentary issues of composition. The class is designed to benefit all levels of ability, from beginner to individuals with experience.

# PAINTING

# halfcourse

PAINTINGhalfcourseStressing painting from observation, this course provides a foundation in the use of oil paint and brush techniques through subjects such as landscape, still life, portraits and self- portraiture, and painting from photographs.

# DIGITALPHOTOGRAPHYIGESC

# offered as a term course and halfcourse

DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY I GESCOffered as a term course and halfcourseIn these courses, students learn the fundamentals of digital photography, starting with proper control, handling, and exposure using a contemporary digital camera. Lessons in capture, resolution consideration, image enhancement/manipulation (utilizing Adobe Photoshop), and ink jet printing techniques are explored. In addition, we discuss the medium's relationship to cultural, historical, and aesthetic issues within a fine art context. Students will find it beneficial to have their own DSLR or mirrorless digital camera for the course, but it is not required. The department has a limited number of cameras available to check out.

# DIGITALPHOTOGRAPHYII term course

DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY II/term courseThis course continues to explore the digital photographic environment, with students learning more complex techniques in Adobe Photoshop. Analogies are made between traditional darkroom practices and digital ones. Students develop a more personal relationship to the medium, which culminates in both a digital and a printed portfolio plus the creation of a printed hardcover photobook. Prerequisite: Digital Photography I

# ADVANCED DIGITAL PHOTO II/term course

ADVANCED DIGITAL PHOTO II/term courseThis course is for students who completed Digital Photography I and II and have shown the ability to work on a self- directed thematic project over an extended period of time that would culminate in an exhibition in the Barnes and Wilde Galleries. In addition, each student will research historically important photographers and/or photographic genres and give two substantial presentations to the Digital Photography I classes within the term. A final portfolio will round out this term course. Prerequisite: Digital Photography II and permission of the department

# DIGITAL ART FOUNDATIONS

halfcourse/not offered 2025- 26

DIGITAL ART FOUNDATIONSHalfcourse/not offered 2025- 26This course covers the basics of visual communication to help students design more attractive and polished content for use in class (presentations, infographics, animations) and in life (like on social media). In this half course, students will survey digital image making, vector graphics, presentation design, video, and animation, all in service of making projects that address personally expressive topics. Students will also practice their creative thinking skills and learn to innovate from an arts- based perspective.

# GRAPHIC DESIGN GESC halfcourse

GRAPHIC DESIGN GESC halfcourseThis course teaches the underlying principles, techniques, craft, and creative practices of using the computer for art and visual communication. Students will produce a range of computer- based creative projects, which may include digital painting and illustration, photographic manipulation and collage, graphic design for logos and posters, and multi- page publications. In addition, this course will introduce students to the histories, theories, and artists of computer- based art and design. This course covers a range of digital art software, including Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom.

# GAME DESIGN:WHERE ART MEETS CODE halfcourse

GAME DESIGN: WHERE ART MEETS CODE halfcourseThis year- long introductory half course combines the creativity of digital art with the logic of programming to guide students through the process of designing and building their own 2D video games. In the first trimester, students will explore tools and techniques for creating digital art, learning about design principles, color theory, and digital illustration to develop characters, environments, and other visual elements for their games. During the second trimester, students will learn foundational programming concepts and build confidence in coding, while applying their new skills to create programmatically- generated works of art in a beginner- friendly language. In the final trimester, students will bring together their programming skills and artistic creations to develop a simple, playable 2D game. This course emphasizes creativity, problem- solving, and technical skill, empowering students to bring their ideas to life in an interactive format. No prior experience is necessary. This course fulfills one visual arts diploma requirement and prepares students to take CL Computer Science.

# VIDEO AND ANIMATION halfcourse

VIDEO AND ANIMATION halfcourseIn this course students learn the fundamentals of time- based visual art, including filmmaking, video art, special effects, and animation.

The course will emphasize the creative use of materials and fabrication processes.

# INTRODUCTION TO GLASS ART term course

INTRODUCTION TO GLASS ART term courseThis course introduces students to fundamental skills and contextual knowledge for working with kiln- formed glass and stained glass in a contemporary visual art and/or design context. Students will learn skills and methods for cutting, fusing, and shaping glass in response to set projects. Transforming glass with heat and cold processes will be the key skills introduced along with strategies to explore and realize creative works.

# CL SENIOR WRITING SEMINAR: WRITING ABOUT ART term course/contents

CL SENIOR WRITING SEMINAR: WRITING ABOUT ART term course/contentsEngaging with the work of artists and makers, curators, critics, and art historians, this course explores the intersections of writing and art. Visits to the Mercy Gallery, the Loomis Chaffee Archives, and local museums will provide students the opportunity, through criticism, exhibition texts, and essays, to contribute to ongoing cultural dialogue through their own writing. Key topics may include: the shifting roles of art and artists in society; the responsibilities of institutions, curators, and the public in shaping reception; debates about the definition of art and the significance of artistic intent; and the roles that art and objects play as agents of individualism or community building. As they explore writing by critics such as Susan Sontag, John Berger, and Claire Dederer, among others, students will craft their own reflections, analysis, and commentary inspired by art and material culture. Prerequisite: permission of the departments Note: This course does not count toward the diploma requirement in the arts.
