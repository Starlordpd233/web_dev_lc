# Global, Digital Cultures (GESC)
*term course*
Will our fascination with social media and technology lead to our downfall or will it save us? Does technology lead us to become more distrustful of one another and more attached to static definitions of identity, or does it foster better connections and more fluid conceptions of identity?
