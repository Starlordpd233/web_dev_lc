recommendations, the department strongly encourages performances on regularly scheduled Recital Samplers, participation in solo or shared recitals during the junior and senior years, and preparation of a recording for inclusion in the college application process. A music independent study or project may be considered for students who have exhausted the curricular offerings and/or preparing for college auditions.

To be competitive for admission to acting schools and/or to establish a strong theater resume for liberal arts college applications, a serious student should audition for at least one major and one minor production each year as well as take at least one theater course each year. Students concentrating in technical theater, costuming, lighting, set design, scenic art, and stage management may plan to engage in curricular and production offerings each year. Help planning a theater curriculum can be obtained from the faculty early in the student's career.

Students planning to further advance studies and experiences in dance at the college level should plan to audition for Dance Company and may consider classes in choreography and in genres in addition to their concentration or previous experience. There are several performing venues throughout the school year, including major productions Fall Dance Showcase and the Spring Dance Revue, for students to showcase their skills and technique. Planning a course of study with the dance director is encouraged.

The school's arts requirement of three courses for entering freshmen or two courses for all others may be satisfied by any combination of visual arts, daytime dance, theater, or music courses.

Students enrolled in mainstage productions, Stage II, and the Chamber Music Intensive can satisfy team and afternoon activities requirements. See information on Athletics and After- School Program requirements for further information.

# Music Theory and History

# MUSIC COMPOSITION AND THEORY I: FUNDAMENTALS fall term

Have you ever wondered how music works? How do pitch and rhythm make a melody catchy? What makes one chord sound more emotional than another chord? Beginning with the basic elements of music theory - note reading, scales and modes, key and time signatures, intervals and chords, and basic melody writing - this course works to build the musical skills necessary to read, write, and understand melodies, chord progressions and bass lines, seventh chords in inversion, and reading music over four clefs (chorale or quartet style). Students also will begin harmonic analyzation skills. In addition, this course introduces non- western approaches to harmonization and musical organization. The course emphasizes ear training, interval and chord recognition, beginning sight- singing, and melodic dictation. Students will utilize various music theory websites and will explore basic compositional techniques using electronic music notation software. By term's end, students should possess the skills needed to place out of beginning music theory at the college level. No previous theory, vocal, or keyboard skill is required.

# CL MUSIC COMPOSITION AND THEORY II: HARMONY AND HARMONIC ANALYSIS winter term

This course focuses on the direct application of concepts such as chord progressions, part- writing, figured bass, borrowed chords, modulation, and elements of musical form to both students' compositions and the analysis of existing musical works. Students will utilize music notation software to create their own works for solo instruments and piano as well as part- writing in four parts. In addition, classes are formatted with harmonic analysis, ear- training, keyboard instruction, sight singing and multiple clef reading. Students will engage in further discussion of non- western approaches to composition and harmonic form. Local and alumni composers are featured as guest instructors and clinicians. Students wishing to take the AP exam should plan on both CL Music Theory II and III. Prerequisite: CL Music Theory I or permission of the department.

# CL MUSIC COMPOSITION AND THEORY II: FORM AND ADVANCED COMPOSITION spring term
