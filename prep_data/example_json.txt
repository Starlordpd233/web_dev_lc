I have attached the markdown file that contains the course information and offerings. 
What you need to do is to collect the information accurately from the mardown file and create a json file that stores all the 
relevant data about the course in the designated format as below. When there's a bigger header/category as written in the markdown file, 
such as in this case, 
the header "CL Senior Writing Seminars", be sure to wrap all the courses that appear below that header within a new {} environment 
(you know what I'm talking about) so that we know clearly those are writing seminars. In general, organize the data in a very clear, 
unambiguous, and concise way. I will later use this json file to create a website that holds various information about the courses, 
and so each field of information about the course matters. If you can identify the patterns in the name of the courses, such as grouping them
based on some bigger categories (i.e. shared 'title'), say all English IV courses, all CL English IV courses, or all Latin IV/V courses, etc., you can
wrap those courses around in a bigger parent object that uses that shared trait as the key.

Below is a sample field for one course:

{
  "Arabic": {
    "course_title": "Arabic I", // append '(GESC)' and/or '(PPR)' for those that are specified
    "Target_Class_Year": "sophomores", // or "sophomores; juniors", or "seniors; juniors (with permission of the department)", or if not specified, leave it as "N/A"; keep it exactly as written, just make sure to use consistent category description
    "Course_Duration": "year-course", // default year-course, unless "term-course" or "half-course" for those that are specified, or "offered as a term course and half course" for some courses; keep it exactly as written, just make sure to use consistent category description
    "offered_in_2025-26": true, //default true, or false if specified
    "Course_Description": "This yearlong course introduces the basics of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), with an introduction to Levantine Colloquial Arabic (from the region including Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinian Territories).\n\nEmphasis during the first term will be on mastering the 28-letter alphabet of the Arabic script and pronouncing its sounds, with introductory vocabulary and cultural expressions.\n\nThe second and third terms will begin to build vocabulary in Levantine and MSA and teach introductory grammar.\n\nThis course is taught using the Alif Baa and Arabiyyat Al-Naas with accompanying DVDs.\n\nStudents practice their writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills in both the classroom and independently.\n\nThis course is not open to native speakers of Arabic."
    "Prerequisites": "[description]" // "N/A" if not mentioned
  }
}

Be sure to use the EXACT names for the course category and titles, as written in the markdown file. Be consistent in the names and values for the
fields in the json structure.
For the comments above, take them into consideration as you scan through each course in the markdown file. 
If I missed something or some important fields, be sure to remind me.

Notes:

– For "STATISTICS I (GESC) winter" and "STATISTICS II (GESC) spring", ignore for now about this course, since information very unclear. 

– for "UPPER-LEVEL LATIN", ignore for now since it's unclear how the course registration works exactly.

- For CL TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE A and CL TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE B, it should be two different,
separate json fields, each json having the same information except the true and false for the state of
being offered or not in 2025-26. 

– Clearly examine the subheaders for the arts classes. For example, in the class "ART OF DANCE", delete the 'daytime' description from subheader.
– delete those classes that are offered as "after-school tem" or "physical exertion activity", that are not real classes.
