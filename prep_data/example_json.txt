Notes:

â€“ For "STATISTICS I (GESC) winter" and "STATISTICS II (GESC) spring", ignore for now about this course, since information very unclear. 

- For CL TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE A and CL TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE B, it should be two different,
separate json fields, each json having the same information except the true and false for the state of
being offered or not in 2025-26.
