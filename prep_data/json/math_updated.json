      "description": "This course is for those students who either have not had a full year of Algebra I or need to strengthen their algebra skills before heading into Algebra II and subsequent curriculum. It covers properties of the real number system, linear and quadratic equations, and prop- erties of exponents and radicals while also introducing students to Euclidian geometry of two and three dimensions. Students develop competence with the graphs of linear, qua- dratic, and exponential equations, and master multiple techniques for solving equations and simplifying algebraic expressions. This course emphasizes the development of algebraic and geometric skills and utilizes Desmos, Delta Math, Problem Attic, and Geogebra. Students who successfully complete this course will have met the diploma requirement for Geometry and be prepared for Algebra II.",
