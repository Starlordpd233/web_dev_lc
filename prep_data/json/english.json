Organized around the study of global literature, this course allows students to study short stories, memoirs, novels, dramas, and poetry. Writing progresses from the construction of single paragraphs to multi-paragraph compositions, developing students' skills in crafting both interpretive essays and personal narratives and leading to their final writing project, which develops and combines both styles of writing into a single, coherent essay. Throughout the year, the course emphasizes vocabulary, grammar, and punctuation. Representative readings include Sophocles' Antigone, Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, poetry, short stories, and classic and contemporary fiction.",

Why?\" Ghost stories have been around for as long as people have been; they have long served as the vehicles through which societies and individuals express their fears, traumas, and things best swept under the rug. If history is written by winners, then ghost stories are written by losers — or, those disenfranchised seeking to reclaim their voice. Spanning all forms and all cultures, the ghost story is a universally employed medium to commune with things that most would prefer stay under the bed. In this course, students will learn not only about the many ghosts of our society and how they take form, but also of art as a form of activism and a memorial of past injustices. The course will emphasize ideas of the importance of truth-telling and the power of old wives' tales, fairy tales, or the stories told by those we all too often dismiss as crazy.

In this course, we will read the stories of individuals and groups who have journeyed to new places—often out of a desire for a better life but just as often because of involuntary displacement or the need to escape horrific circumstances. Of course, with this change of region, country, or continent comes not only some form of severance from the old place and the old culture but the need to cope with the strangeness of a new country and culture. Consequently, many of the questions we will ask of these texts will concern personal identity—how much is it tied to place? Does a new country or place mean a new identity? What does it mean to reconstruct one's life in a new place? Migration is not a narrow or isolated experience—there's a broad range of groups who have experienced and written about this experience—from Irish immigrants fleeing the 1840s Irish famine to the Great Migration in the early-to-mid-20th century to modern migrants fleeing poverty and political strife in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Potential texts might include Wilson's Joe Turner's Come and Gone, Adichie's Americanah, Cisneros' House on Mango Street, Nayeri's The Ungrateful Refugee: What Immigrants Never Tell You or The Penguin Book of Migration Literature.",

Juvenal, the Roman satirist, once said, \"It's hard not to write satire,\" suggesting that targets abound for those willing to poke fun at their fellow human beings and their many institutions. Through exploration of satirical novels and pop culture publications alike, this course explores how writers use wit and irony to challenge norms, expose hypocrisy, and spark conversation. Along the way, students examine both how and why satire works, considering in the process the role of humor, hyperbole, mockery, understatement, and other tools of the trade. Representative texts may include the works of authors such as Jonathan Swift, Kurt Vonnegut, Jane Austen, Paul Beatty, and Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah.",

This course explores the art of literary adaptation, examining how stories are transformed across a range of forms, from novels, short stories, poems, and plays to their retellings in other literary genres, performance arts, film, or other visual arts. Through comparative study, we'll ask critical questions such as: What changes when a story transitions between different forms, and what does that reveal about the storytelling tools of those different creative forms? How do creators—be they writers, directors, or other artists—reinterpret texts for new audiences? What roles do historical, cultural, and artistic contexts play in shaping these adaptations? With a focus on analyzing both original texts and their diverse adaptations, students will consider not only how meaning is constructed differently across mediums but also how adaptations can illuminate or obscure aspects of race, gender, class, and culture.",

From wilderness to the worked landscape, from suburban to urban environments, students will examine the ways that the language of literature, film, and popular media construct our awareness and appreciation of the non-human world.

Closely associated with 20th-century Latin American authors such as Gabriel García Márquez and Jorge Luis Borges, magical realism has attained a truly global reach, as writers and artists from around the world have employed it to reflect and refract deeper understandings of society. This course will explore magical realism in its Latin American context and across cultures, in prose, poetry, and film. Beginning with the works of Márquez and Borges, the course will attempt to isolate a set of characteristics that define magical realism. From there, students will explore how other authors have experimented with magical realism around the world and compare how those artists have utilized magical realism in their own ways. From the works of Lin Manuel Miranda to Kazuo Ishiguro and Jesmyn Ward, the class will see how the threads of magical realism can connect Latin America and the wider world and how place and genre can open a broader understanding of the ways artists manipulate reality to develop meaning.",

This course will focus on some of the prominent writers of the movement in an attempt to uncover the stylistic tendencies of their work and the impact those writings had, both on other writers of the period and on the larger culture as a whole. Students will also experience a selection of art, music, and essay as they develop strategies for understanding what bound these artists together into a generally accepted \"movement\" and for determining how their work still influences writers today. Students will be expected to connect their close reading of individual texts to broader literary and social context.

Our primary mode of exploring these questions will be through an older technology - prose writing. We'll begin by defining what algorithms are and how they feed off data. We'll then turn and examine specific categories of technology and how they impact parts of what it means to be human. Topics might include social media algorithms, fitness and health monitoring, algorithms in finance, and artificial intelligence. We'll also explore the ethical questions surrounding computing such as algorithmic bias, the attention economy, and questions of data privacy. In fitting with the PHI's drive to \"make something and make a difference\", the writing in this course will all engage directly with audiences that have direct stakes in the content of the course.

Visits to the Mercy Gallery, the Loomis Chaffee Archives, and local museums will provide students the opportunity, through criticism, exhibition texts, and essays, to contribute to ongoing cultural dialogue through their own writing. Key topics may include: the shifting roles of art and artists in society; the responsibilities of institutions, curators, and the public in shaping reception; debates about the definition of art and the significance of artistic intent; and the roles that art and objects play as agents of individualism or community building. As they explore writing by critics such as Susan Sontag, John Berger, and Claire Dederer, among others, students will craft their own reflections, analysis, and commentary inspired by art and material culture.",
