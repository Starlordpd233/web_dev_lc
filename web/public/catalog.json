Even today, school administrators, religious leaders, authoritarian regimes, and democracies continue to censor texts that pose a threat to their values. With societies around the world opening new conversations on free speech and political correctness, this course aims to consider when, if ever, censorship is justified. In doing so, we will discuss how banned books reflect the cultures in which they are written. Readings will include texts banned on political grounds (e.g., Fahrenheit 451, Wild Swans), on religious grounds (e.g., Slaughterhouse-Five, The Satanic Verses), on moral grounds (e.g., “The Wife of Bath’s Tale,” The Handmaid’s Tale, The Bluest Eye), and for other controversial content (e.g., The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Drown).",

Why?” Ghost stories have been around for as long as people have been; they have long served as the vehicles through which societies and individuals express their fears, traumas, and things best swept under the rug. If history is written by winners, then ghost stories are written by losers - or, those disenfran- chised seeking to reclaim their voice. Spanning all forms and all cultures, the ghost story is a universally employed medium to commune with things that most would prefer stay under the bed. In this course, students will learn not only about the many ghosts of our society and how they take form, but also of art as a form of activism and a memorial of past injustices. The course will emphasize ideas of the importance of truth-telling and the power of old wives’ tales, fairy tales, or the stories told by those we all too often dismiss as crazy. Representative texts might include Ahmed Saadawi’s Franken- stein in Baghdad, Carmen Maria Machado’s Her Body and Other Parties, Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, and others. 12 Course Offerings & Descriptions 2025-26ENGLISH IV: GRAPHIC NOVEL GESC term course Since the ground-breaking publication of Art Spiegelman’s Maus in 1993, graphic novels have entered the global cultural and academic mainstream, inspiring complex interdisciplin- ary and multicultural analyses. In this course students will survey the current field and read works of fiction (Watchmen, Asterios Polyp, The Arrival), autobiography (Maus, Persepolis, Fun Home), and journalism (Safe Area Gorazade). In order to understand these works and the cultures that produced them, students will write essays using interpretive lenses focusing on history, gender, psychology, and class.

    "description": "Humans migrating to new places, new coun- tries, and new continents is a story as old as time-not just something for the current news cycle. In this course, we will read the stories of individuals and groups who have journeyed to new places-often out of a desire for a better life but just as often because of involuntary displacement or the need to escape horrific circumstances. Of course, with this change of region, country, or continent comes not only some form of severance from the old place and the old culture but the need to cope with the strangeness of a new country and culture. Consequently, many of the questions we will ask of these texts will concern personal identity-how much is it tied to place? Does a new country or place mean a new identity? What does it mean to reconstruct one’s life in a new place? Migration is not a narrow or isolated experience-there’s a broad range of groups who have experienced and written about this experience-from Irish immigrants fleeing the 1840s Irish famine to the Great Migration in the early-to-mid-20th century to modern migrants fleeing poverty and political strife in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Poten- tial texts might include Wilson’s Joe Turner’s Come and Gone, Adiche’s Americanah, Cisneros’ House on Mango Street, Nayeri’s The Ungrateful Refugee: What Immigrants Never Tell You or The Penguin Book of Migration Literature.ENGLISH IV: RACE, ROLES,",

Through exploration of satirical novels and pop culture publications alike, this course explores how writers use wit and irony to challenge norms, expose hypocrisy, and spark conversation. Along the way, students examine both how and why satire works, considering in the process the role of humor, hyperbole, mockery, understatement, and other tools of the trade.

Through comparative study, we’ll ask critical questions such as: What changes when a story transitions between different forms, and what does that reveal about the storytelling tools of those different creative forms? How do creators-be they writers, directors, or other artists-reinterpret texts for new audiences? What roles do historical, cultural, and artistic contexts play in shaping these adaptations?

Closely associated with 20th-century Latin American authors such as Gabriel García Márquez and Jorge Luis Borges, magical realism has attained a truly global reach, as writers and artists from around the world have employed it to reflect and refract deeper understandings of society. This course will explore magical realism in its Latin American context and across cultures, in prose, poetry, and film. Beginning with the works of Márquez and Borges, the course will attempt to isolate a set of characteristics that define mag- ical realism. From there, students will explore how other authors have experimented with magical realism around the world and compare how those artists have utilized magical realism in their own ways. From the works of Lin Manuel Miranda to Kazuo Ishiguro and Jesmyn Ward, the class will see how the threads of magical realism can connect Latin America and the wider world and how place and genre can open a broader understanding of the ways artists manipulate reality to develop meaning.

This course will focus on some of the prominent writers of the movement in an attempt to uncover the stylistic tendencies of their work and the impact those writings had, both on other writers of the period and on the larger culture as a whole. Students will also experience a selection of art, music, and essay as they develop strategies for understanding what bound these artists together into a generally accepted “movement” and for determining how their work still influ- ences writers today. Students will be expected to connect their close reading of individual texts to broader literary and social context.

The course operates from the premise that it is imperative to understand not only how technologies function, but also how they interface with the ways we work, learn, play, and socialize. Our primary mode of exploring these questions will be through an older technology - prose writing. We’ll begin by defining what algorithms are and how they feed off data. We’ll then turn and examine specific categories of technology and how they impact parts of what it means to be human. Topics might include social media algorithms, fitness and health monitoring, algorithms in finance, and artificial intelli- gence. We’ll also explore the ethical questions surrounding computing such as algorithmic bias, the attention economy, and questions of data privacy. In fitting with the PHI’s drive to “make something and make a difference”, the writing in this course will all engage directly with audiences that have direct stakes in the content of the course.

The tradition of philosophical thought extends back at least 2,500 years as some of the greatest thinkers have endeavored to make sense and find meaning in our lives. Modern philosophy can be viewed as the systematic attempt to make explicit certain aspects and assumptions that are implicit in our experience, beliefs, values, and rational thought processes as well as the attempt to organize those insights into a comprehensive, internally consistent world view that encompasses the large issues of what there is, how and what we can know, what things have intrinsic value, how ought one lead one’s life, and what are the properties of personhood. This course explores critical philosophical questions in three general areas: theory of knowledge, the philosophy of mind, and ethics. Readings, podcasts, and documentaries from major contemporary philosophers as well as an exposure to some of the most significant philosophers from the past, serve as spring- boards for discussion. Students should learn to think critically and express themselves clearly in writing and conversation as they reflect on the coherence and consistency of their beliefs and various philosophical positions.",

To what extent is our knowledge determined and/or limited by the constitution of our mind or brain? The course confronts early on (as did modern epistemology) the radical skeptic’s challenge that we can never be justified in our claims to know an external world, and then examines possible foundational principles of evidence and reasoning proposed to overcome that challenge. Some of the following topics are considered: the nature of scientific method, the problem of induction, the nature and justifica- tion of causal claims, principles of justification assumed in inferences from sense experience to reports about physical objects, philosophical theories of perception, the nature of conscious- ness, the mind-body problem, and the impact of modern neurological research and the chal- lenge to knowledge posed by the problem of implicit bias. The assignments include readings from historical and contemporary philosophers as well as readings, podcasts, and documenta- ries focused on the intersection of epistemol- ogy, cognitive science, and neuroscience.TOPICS IN ETHICAL THEORY GESC PPR term course Some of the earliest and most important ques- tions to engage philosophers dealt with the moral nature of human behavior. What is the basis of moral judgment? What makes a right action right and wrong action wrong? Is norma- tivity a matter of consequences or a matter of custom, duty, or rights? Is what’s right for me necessarily right for you? Or what’s right for us necessarily right for them? Using a collection of readings from both ancient and modern philos- ophers, as well as various secondary sources, this course familiarizes students with the terms and implications of this discussion as well as introducing them to a number of normative ethical theories ranging from ethical egoism and ethical absolutism to utilitarianism and Kantian ethics. Additionally, students will reflect on and seek to articulate their own ethical frameworks. Lastly, students will endeavor to understand what light these normative ethical theories can shed on practical considerations and contemporary topics like animal rights, human equality, environmentalism, abortion, euthanasia, and absolute poverty.",

Students analyze theologies, texts, and communities of religions using a comparative approach to gain insights into their concepts of gender and sexuality. Topics are covered in a case-study format by comparing two or more sources in these religions: the Abrahamic faiths, Buddhism, Hinduism, and spiritual traditions of Indigenous peoples in the United States. Sample topics include: • The Divine: Is the primary deity of this religion viewed as male, female, or beyond gender distinctions? • Creation myths: What do the creation myths of various religions tell us about gender roles and sexuality? • Authority: Are the primary religious leaders for this religion of a particular gender? Which religions have allowed women to also begin to step forward as spiritual leaders? • Society: How do the key religious texts refer to people in society, and do they foster gender equality or inequality? What do the religious texts prescribe regarding gender roles in the home and in society? • Rites and Rituals: Which religious prac - tices are differentiated on the basis of gender in religious texts and practices? • Regulating bodies: What do various religious traditions say about modesty, dress, and reproductive rights? • Empowerment: How have people marginalized for their gender found empowerment within various religions? • LGBTQ+: To what extent have those in the LGBTQ+ communities been embraced or excluded by various religions? How and why is sexuality a central area of religious attention, in both the past and present? • Popular conceptions: How do religious conceptions of gender and sexuality spill",

The death of God and the end of religion was just a matter of time. It is not often that bright, educated people read the signs of the times so poorly. Today, religion continues to play an important role in every country and in almost every area of human experience, from economics and politics to culture and morality.

However, psycho- logical research has found that in reality, people are often influenced by emotions. Behavioral Economics aims to reconcile economic and psychological theory in order to explore why people behave the way they do in the real world. This course will study the various heuristics (or cognitive shortcuts) humans use in decision making that result in biases. Are people’s buying decisions dictated more by preference or by price? Are people more driven to seek gains or avoid losses? Why do retailers raise prices just to then markdown items to a sale price? Diving into topics such as herding, nudging, price anchoring, and prospect theory, students will begin to understand why people make decisions that are not always in their self-interest. Applying these theories to real world contexts, including possible examples in sports, healthcare, and social media, students will be able to appreciate their practical significance. This course fulfills a psychology, philosophy, and religious studies diploma requirement.MACROECONOMICS GESC term course/juniors and seniors This course takes a deep dive into the US econ- omy as well as the economies of various coun- tries around the world.

This course invites students to do the opposite: closely examine the role and impact that com- puters have on the human world. The course operates from the premise that it is imperative to understand not only how technologies function, but also how they interface with the ways we work, learn, play, and socialize. Our primary mode of exploring these questions will be through an older technology - prose writing. We’ll begin by defining what algorithms are and how they feed off data. We’ll then turn and examine specific categories of technology and how they impact parts of what it means to be human. Topics might include social media algorithms, fitness and health monitoring, algorithms in finance, and artificial intelligence. We’ll also explore the ethical questions sur - rounding computing such as algorithmic bias, the attention economy, and questions of data privacy. In fitting with the PHI’s drive to “make something and make a difference”, the writing in this course will all engage directly with audiences that have direct stakes in the content of the course. Examples of this might include engaging authors about their work, reaching out to legislators, writing amicus briefs for current court cases, or connecting with local community members or organizations through writing.
